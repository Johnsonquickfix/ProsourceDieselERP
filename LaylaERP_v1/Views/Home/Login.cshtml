Is the adjustable base difficult to assemble?<i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></div><div class="toggcontent"><p>Not at all. The Layla Adjustable™ and The Layla Adjustable Plus™ are both the easiest adjustable bases in the industry to assemble. Simply unfold the bed, screw on the legs, and plug it in. Now you’re ready to sleep in any position you like.</p></div></div><div class="sep-faq" id="accor_613796"><div class="toggtitle">2.

Of course we recommend using a Layla® mattress with the adjustable base, however any mattress will work fine as long as it is adjustable base friendly.

Both a King and a Split King are two pieces joined together with a clamp. It just depends on whether you plan on using a single King mattress or two Twin XL mattresses on your base.</p><p>If you’re using a King Mattress: Simply join the two bases with the included sync cable and now both halves will move together in unison. Both remotes will control the now synchronized adjustable base.</p><p>If you’re using 2 Twin XL Mattresses: Join the two bases together with the included clamp and you’re done. By NOT joining the two bases with the included sync cable you may now operate each half independently with each remote.</p></div></div><div class="sep-faq" id="accor_613798"><div class="toggtitle">4. How do I know if I want a King or a Split King?<i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></div><div class="toggcontent"><p>Since both the King and Split King adjustable bases are two pieces it really comes down to what mattress you have. If you have a king size mattress you’ll want to connect the two halves with the included sync cable. Now simply place your king mattress on top of the adjustable base and both halves will move together with either remote.</p><p>If you have two Twin XL mattresses, then don’t connect the sync cable so that each half moves independently.</p><p>Haven't bought your mattress yet? If you’re not sure whether you’d like a King or a Split King setup here are a few things that may help you decide:</p><p>KING (ONE KING SIZE MATTRESS)<br> Both sides move up and down simultaneously.<br> Uses a King mattress so there are no gaps between you and your sleeping partner.<br> Will need king size bedding.<br> SPLIT KING (2 TWIN XL MATTRESSES)<br> Allows for each side to move independently so that you can sit up and read while your sleeping partner lays flat and sleeps.<br> Uses two Twin XL mattresses. Expect a slight gap between the two beds.<br> Will need two sets of Twin XL bed sheets.</p><p>Note: If you decide to go with a Split King adjustable base remember to add two Twin XL mattresses to your shopping cart.</p></div></div><div class="sep-faq" id="accor_613799"><div class="toggtitle">5. If I have a Split King adjustable base can I still use my Amazon Echo or Google Home?<i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></div><div class="toggcontent"><p>You will need to program two separate devices and give them different names.

Programming instructions are included with each base.</p></div></div><div class="sep-faq" id="accor_613800"><div class="toggtitle">6.

Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which Layla’s principle place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial. This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.</p><p _ngcontent-serverapp-c35="">Miscellaneous: You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall be subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change this Agreement from time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. You acknowledge your responsibility to review this Agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such changes. By continuing to participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this Agreement, as modified.</p></div>
