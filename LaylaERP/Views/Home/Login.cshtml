                            All foams used in the Layla® Mattress are CertiPUR-US® certified, meaning the foam is:
                            Made without ozone depleters
                            Made without PBDEs, TDCPP or TCEP (”Tris”) flame retardants

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The Layla® Mattress keeps you cooler in two ways; Copper in the foam and ThermoGEL in the cover. Copper cells in the mattress act as a super-conductor to absorb body heat and rapidly transfer it away from your body. ThermoGEL is a food grade cooling agent in the cover that activates when your body temp begins to rise to cool you down quickly.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">9. Is the Layla® Mattress fire resistant?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes. The Layla® Mattress uses a Ventex fire blocking sleeve which is made with 48% FR Rayon Allesandra and 52% FR Rayon Polyester. There are absolutely no chemicals added, the fire blocking elements are within the fabric itself.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The Layla® Mattress is proudly made in the USA. Our foam is poured and the mattress assembled in the Rust belt region of the Midwestern United States. Our mattress cover and label are both made in the Southeast region of the United States. From time to time we experience heavier than normal order volume, and to avoid any backorder delays we send our American made fabric to El Salvador and Mexico to be cut and sewn.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">11. Does copper in the Layla® Mattress really make a difference?</button>

                        <p>Yes. There are several great benefits to sleeping on copper infused foam. Copper facilitates rapid heat transfer keeping you cooler, it provides variable support to relieve pressure points, and it provides antimicrobial protection for the mattress.

                        <p>Yes, you may place a cover or protector on the Layla® Mattress if you so desire however, keep in mind that any additional covering on the mattress may diminish the cooling properties of the mattress to some extent. To minimize reduction of cooling effects, we suggest a cover or protector made from a highly breathable material.</p>

                        <p>You can put a Layla® Mattress directly on the floor, but we don't recommend it long-term as it's not best for airflow and moisture accumulation and may void your warranty.</p>

For those who are sensitive to smell, you may detect a slight “new mattress” smell after unboxing.

                            • Individually wrapped springs giving a more traditional feel (The original Layla Mattress does not have springs)

                        <p>
                            There are many features and benefits to the Layla Hybrid™ mattress provided by each layer:
                            Cover: Our super-soft high quality thick fabric allows for a comfortable sleeping experience and is removable for easy cleaning and maintenance.
                            Copper Infused Memory Foam: Infusing copper into the memory foam provides:
                            - Cooling: Copper pulls heat away from the body creating a cool sleep environment.
                            - Variable Support: When placed under pressure copper particles condense creating a firming response under areas that require additional support such as shoulders and hips
                            - Cleaning: Copper is also anti-microbial and helps kills germs, bacteria, and viruses.
                            Layla Tri-Zone-Airflow™ Foam: The tri-zone layers provide more support in the center of the mattress (for hips and shoulders) and also allow hot air to leave the mattress while cool fresh air flows in.
                            Individually Wrapped Coils
                            With high quality American Made springs individually wrapped in fabric you get individual support for every inch of your body. Springs move independently so when your partner moves around your side of the bed stays put allowing you to sleep soundly through the night.
                            Infinity Edge™ Support
                            Higher gauge springs around the perimeter of the mattress make for better edge support.

                            Mattress Warranty Exclusions and Limitations: This warranty applies only to the original purchaser and is valid if used properly. Proper use is defined as using the mattress on a firm, rigid and smooth surface that allows air ventilation and supports the entire mattress, INCLUDING THE CENTER, such as a slatted bed platform or box spring. Note: Using a boxspring foundation manufactured by any other brand besides Layla Sleep® Inc. may void the mattress warranty. Proper use also means that the product was not abused by the purchaser. This includes keeping the mattress properly protected and free of moisture.
                            This warranty does not apply to a purchaser’s personal comfort preferences, such as the firmness of the mattress, bed height, weight, etc., or to normal body impressions of 1″ or less.
                            Mattress Manufacturing Defects include: (a) seams coming apart; (b) visible permanent compression of the mattress surface greater than 1″; (c) loss of mattress shape beyond 1”.
                            Mattress Manufacturing Defects DO NOT include: (a) faults in the cosmetic appearance, such as wrinkles on the fabric (b) cosmetic changes that naturally occur over time, including natural blemishes in the fabric; (c) mattresses that may have been soiled, dampened, burned, stained or otherwise abused; (d) mattress dimension (width, length and or height) discrepancies of up to +-1″; and/or (h) appearance of mold on and/or infestation with vermin (such as bed bugs) due to improper and unsanitary care of the mattress. Also, we do not guarantee your new mattress will not have a scent. All natural and man-made materials can have a scent and often do. None of our materials have a toxic emission based on scientific, 3rd party verification.
                            Voiding of Warranty
                            The following cases may void any and all warranties:
                            – Leaving the Layla® mattress in the box for more than two weeks after receiving
                            – Using a foundation manufactured by any brand other than Layla Sleep®.
                            – Using a metal bed frame that doesn’t have a center support bar
                            – Using a base with slats spaced more than 4” apart.
                            – Using the Layla® mattress without a mattress protector.
                            – Using the Layla® mattress for any commercial use i.e. Hotels, motels, rental properties, hostels, dorms, schools, shelters, rooming and boarding homes, bread and breakfasts, vacation rentals, etc.
                            Warranty Performance: We will repair or replace the defective mattress or the defective component(s) of the mattress. In the case of a manufacturing defect in a component of the mattress, such as the mattress cover, we may elect to repair or replace the component rather than replace the entire mattress, and we reserve sole and complete discretion over that election. If we elect to replace the mattress or component, we will replace it with the model, version, color, or style available at the time of replacement, which may be different in certain respects than the original. There may be a shipping fee up to $50 associated with warranty repairs or replacement (this fee will be evaluated on a case by case basis by Layla Sleep® Inc.). Warranty does not cover the shipping cost for replacement items or components.

                    <button class="accordion">1. What is the Layla Pillow?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The Layla Pillow is soft and supportive filled with a mix of Kapok tree fibers and shredded memory foam. The copper infused cover of the pillow is custom crafted to match the Layla Mattress.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">2. What is Kapok?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Kapok is a tree that grows in Indonesia and the seed pod fibers are sustainably harvested for use as fill in the pillow. Kapok fibers are extremely light and airy with more loft than cotton or wool.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">3. Is the memory foam in the Layla Pillow safe?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>
                            Yes. The premium reactive memory foam that is shredded and used as fill in the Layla Pillow is CertiPUR-US® certified, meaning the foam is:
                            Made without ozone depleters
                            Made without PBDEs, TDCPP or TCEP (”Tris”) flame retardants
                            Made without mercury, lead, and other heavy metals
                            Made without formaldehyde
                            Made without phthalates regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission
                            Low VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) emissions for indoor air quality (less than 0.5 parts per million) so there’s little to no off gassing odor.

                        <p>The Layla Pillow like the Layla Mattress is the perfect balance of soft and supportive. You will feel the plush softness of fluffy Kapok, but still have the support of reactive memory foam to keep your neck happy.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">5. Is the Layla Pillow hypoallergenic?</button>

                        <p>Copper fibers woven into the Layla Pillow cover absorb body heat and quickly transfer it away from your noggin. Copper fibers also act as an antimicrobial barrier to keep out the nasty.

                            The Layla Pillow is available in two sizes:
                            Standard: 18" x 28"
                            King: 18" x 34"

                    <button class="accordion">1. Unboxing the Layla Pillow</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The fill inside your pillow will be compressed and bunched up a bit when you remove it from the box. Don't worry, this is normal. After you remove your pillow from the box, place it on a flat surface and use the palms of your hands or fists to massage the pillow and distribute the fill evenly. This will flatten the pillow out a bit to achieve a pillow height that will support your neck perfectly.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">2. Does the Layla Pillow have an odor?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>You may experience a "new pillow" or “memory foam” smell which can go away in as soon as a few hours but may last a little longer for those who are sensitive to smell. This odor is not harmful to your health but if it bothers you we recommend allowing a couple of hours in a well ventilated room to allow your pillow to air out before placing a pillow case over it.</p>

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The pillow cover is removable and washable, but we suggest spot cleaning the pillow with a mild non-toxic cleaner and washing only when necessary. It's best to wash the pillow by hand, but you may run the pillow through a washing machine on a gentle cycle and dry it in a dryer on a low heat setting, although it may take several cycles for the pillow to dry completely. Since there is no way for us to verify the suitability of your machine, we do not recommend washing or drying the pillow in any machine as doing so may void the pillow warranty.</p>

                        <p>It’s simple! Unzip the removable cover, then unzip the inner lining. Now you can remove or add as much fill as you need until the pillow is just right for you.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">1. Can I wash the pillow?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Throwing the entire pillow in the washing machine can be done but drying the pillow once washed can require multiple dry cycles. For this reason we designed the pillow to have an inner lining that holds all the fill. That way you can just remove the exterior cover and throw it in the wash. We recommend washing with cold water and tumble dry on low heat.</p>

                        <p>The Layla® Topper was designed to work perfectly on top of most mattresses, regardless of brand, whether they be spring, foam, or a hybrid of both. And of course the Layla Topper works like magic when placed on top of a Layla Mattress..</p>

Next, simply put on your mattress protector (if you have one or choose to use one), and then make your bed with your normal fitted and flat bed sheets.</p>

                            The Layla® Topper cover can be unzipped and removed for easier cleaning. However we do recommend dry cleaning to maintain the soft, plush feel of the cover. If you decide to wash by machine, we suggest cold water on a gentle cycle, dry on delicate with low heat.

                            Since we are unable to verify the suitability of your machine, washing in a machine may damage the topper cover. Any damages caused by washing are not covered under warranty.

                            <p>The Layla® Bamboo Sheets are made of 100% Viscose from Bamboo. Viscose is described as the process used to turn natural bamboo into fabric. The Bamboo is broken up and dissolved in a solution. Once the bamboo is dissolved, the solution is pressed into fibers and cooled. Finally, these fibers are spun into threads and woven into fabric.</p>

                                    <p>Each full, queen, king, and cal-king sheet set includes 1 fitted sheet, 1 flat sheet and 2 pillowcases. The twin and twin xl sets includes 1 fitted sheet, 1 flat sheet and 1 pillowcase.</p>

                                <div class="panel">
                                    <p>Bamboo thread count is very different from other fabric thread counts. Our sheets are 300, but the feel is softer than 1,000-thread-count Egyptian cotton.</p>

                                        Bamboo is softer, more durable, cooler, and more breathable than traditional cotton or polyester sheets. The Layla Bamboo set is also hypoallergenic, antibacterial, and moisture wicking so you can enjoy a dry, clean, and cool sleep.

                                        Using bamboo also has environmental benefits since bamboo is grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers, requires no irrigation, rarely needs replanting, grows rapidly and can be harvested in 3-5 years, and produces 35% more oxygen than equivalent trees.

                                        Additionally, bamboo is a critical element in the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and is an excellent soil erosion inhibitor.

                                    <p>If you’re someone who loses sleep from sweating or sleeping hot, or you’re just in need of very comfortable sheets, then the Layla® Bamboo Sheets are right for you. Bamboo fabric is breathable, thermal regulating, wicks moisture better than polyester performance fabrics, will resist odor and is absorbent, keeping you dryer and more comfortable than any cotton or polyester fabrics.</p>

                                    <p>Yes! Bamboo is naturally hypo-allergenic and anti-bacterial. Bamboo sheets prevent allergies because they reduce the amount of moisture in your bed that attract allergens and dust mites.</p>

                                    <p>Absolutely. The Bamboo used in the Layla® Bamboo Sheets are naturally made without any pesticides or fertilizers. The Bamboo plant requires very little water and regenerates extremely fast, making it a great purchase for any green thumb.</p>

                                            <p>Weighted blankets are purposely made slightly smaller than the size of your mattress. You don’t want your weighted blanket hanging over the sides of your mattress otherwise it will inevitably pull toward the floor and fall off, leaving you cold and lonely.</p>
                                        </div>

                                        <div class="panel">
                                            <p>The top (black layer) of the weighted blanket is made with 300 thread count 100% cotton. While the bottom layer (closest to you) is made with 100% polyester and mink fabric.</p>
                                        </div>

                                            <p>The weighted blanket is great to use while you lounge on a chair, couch, or even when sleeping in bed.</p>

                                        <div class="panel">
                                            <p>Not at all. We use high quality glass beads instead of lower quality soft plastic pellets, fewer beads are used, resulting in a much slimmer blanket compared to others on the market. Plastic pellets tend to have texture similar to pebbles, whereas micro glass beads provide a smoother feel, similar to sand.</p>

                                        <button class="accordion">6. What makes the weighted blanket heavy?</button>
                                        <div class="panel">
                                            <p>The Layla® Weighted Blanket is filled with high density, non-toxic, micro glass beads that are evenly distributed throughout the blanket in Layla’s precisely stitched pattern.</p>

                                        <div class="panel">
                                            <p>Yes. The Layla® weighted blanket is certified free of lead and other harmful chemicals that might affect some sleepers. Each weighted blanket is filled with non-toxic glass beads that are seamlessly stitched together for a strong hold ensuring no leaks.</p>

                                        <div class="panel">
                                            <p>Weighted blankets are thought to help children with Autism and anxiety disorders. They are believed to be beneficial to adults with PTSD, insomnia, or restless leg syndrome. The weight from Layla’s weighted blanket is designed to have many therapeutic benefits by relieving stress from deep-touch pressure stimulation. This leads to a calming effect that causes many people to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.</p>

                                        <div class="panel">
                                            <p>Micro glass beads are infused inside the Layla® weighted blanket to make it feel heavy. Glass beads are much finer and smoother than other fillings, such as plastic pellets that are lumpy and make a significant amount of noise when moved.</p>

All three protectors will protect against allergens, dust mites, dead skin cells and bodily fluids that can turn into fungus or mold. If you’re looking for 5 sided protection without breaking the bank the Essential is right for you. For hot sleepers that want all the benefits of the Essential with added cooling then The Cooling Protector is what you need. And if you need protection against bed bugs then you’ll need The Full Encasement Protector with PESTLOC zipper.</p>

                                                        <div class="panel">
                                                            <p>Not at all. The Layla Adjustable™ and The Layla Adjustable Plus™ are both the easiest adjustable bases in the industry to assemble. Simply unfold the bed, screw on the legs, and plug it in. Now you’re ready to sleep in any position you like.</p>
                                                        </div>

                                                            <p>It sure does. Of course we recommend using a Layla® mattress with the adjustable base, however any mattress will work fine as long as it is adjustable base friendly. If you’re not sure we recommend asking the manufacturer.</p>

                                                        <div class="panel">
                                                            <p>
                                                                It really comes down to the wire… literally. Both a King and a Split King are two pieces joined together with a clamp. It just depends on whether you plan on using a single King mattress or two Twin XL mattresses on your base.

                                                                If you’re using a King Mattress: Simply join the two bases with the included sync cable and now both halves will move together in unison. Both remotes will control the now synchronized adjustable base.

                                                                If you’re using 2 Twin XL Mattresses: Join the two bases together with the included clamp and you’re done. By NOT joining the two bases with the included sync cable you may now operate each half independently with each remote.
                                                            </p>

                                                        <div class="panel">
                                                            <p>
                                                                Since both the King and Split King adjustable bases are two pieces it really comes down to what mattress you have. If you have a king size mattress you’ll want to connect the two halves with the included sync cable. Now simply place your king mattress on top of the adjustable base and both halves will move together with either remote.

                                                                If you have two Twin XL mattresses, then don’t connect the sync cable so that each half moves independently.

                                                                Haven't bought your mattress yet? If you’re not sure whether you’d like a King or a Split King setup here are a few things that may help you decide:

                                                                KING (ONE KING SIZE MATTRESS)
                                                                Both sides move up and down simultaneously.
                                                                Uses a King mattress so there are no gaps between you and your sleeping partner.
                                                                Will need king size bedding.
                                                                SPLIT KING (2 TWIN XL MATTRESSES)
                                                                Allows for each side to move independently so that you can sit up and read while your sleeping partner lays flat and sleeps.
                                                                Uses two Twin XL mattresses. Expect a slight gap between the two beds.
                                                                Will need two sets of Twin XL bed sheets.

                                                                Note: If you decide to go with a Split King adjustable base remember to add two Twin XL mattresses to your shopping cart.

                                                                The Layla Foundation™ would be used for a bed that requires a box spring and can be placed on a metal frame which gives you the option of attaching a headboard.

But just in case… connect the interlocking corners on the rails (make sure the arrows are all pointing up) and drop the included pins through the hole they make. Next, screw the leg plates into all four corners which will allow you to easily spin the legs into the center of the leg plates. Then simply roll out the slats on top of the base and you're done in minutes!</p>
